* Task 1: output.txt 20%
* Task 2: myscript.sh 40% (well commented, complete without bugs, bonus: one that can accept arguments!)
* Task 3: main.c 40% (same criteria as above)

* Note: Your code **must** run on the Khoury machines. That is where you should test it, and this is where we grade it!
* Note: You must also commit any additional files into your repository so we can test your code.
  * Points will be lost if you forget!

# Part 3 - Internet was down. I couldn't complete my labs!

Sometimes ssh is not available if the internet is not and you don't use a Unix-based operating system. Hmm, how will we then work on our Khoury machines which are in a Linux environment? There are several solutions. It is today possible to run Ubuntu terminal on Windows - https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6?activetab=pivot:overviewtab

An alternative is to install a virtual machine. A virtual machine emulates an entire operating system!

The instructions to get setup are here:

* First start downloading the operating system I recommend using: Ubuntu https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop
  * While our Khoury machines are actually CentOS for the operating system, Ubuntu will work just fine (They core kernel is the same).
  * The download is rather large, so start with this step! :)
* Visit https://www.virtualbox.org/
* Download the binary for Virtual box 5.2 or later.
  1. This will show up as "Windows hosts" for window users, OSX hosts for mac users, etc.
* Install the program using the default installation settings (i.e. you will click 'next' a bunch of times).
* When installation has completed, launch Virtaul Box.
* Next click 'new' in the top right, and select *Linux* from the 'Type' dropbown box.
  1. You can name it something like 'myUbuntuMachine'
  2. Click 'next'
  3. You can then configure the memory size. I recommend at least 4096 MB (Unless that is not more than half of what you have available).
  4. Click 'next' and then create a Virtual Hard disk(default option). This essentially creates a giant file that acts like a hard drive.
  5. You can create a VDI (Virtual Disk Image). Click next.
  6. For the storage, you can select 'Dynamically allocated'
* Okay, now you are configured, and ready to boot your OS!
  1. Go ahead and right-click on your machine name, and select 'start'. 
  2. This will begin launching your virtual machine (It may take a few minutes to create some files)
  3. The first dialog will ask where your media is, and you will select wherever you downloaded the Ubuntu 18 .iso file (in step 1).
  4. Then run through the 'normal install'
  5. Follow the dialogs to install Ubuntu.
  6. Remember, you are working within a virtual environment, so this installation is only taking place within virtual box.
  7. From within Ubuntu, try opening a terminal. Run `sudo apt-get install build-essential` to make sure you get some tools(like our compiler gcc) setup.

Again, if you have a linux machine you may not need a virtual machine. What is nice about a virtual machine however, is if you mess something up, you can always reboot it and start from scratch very easily.


*Bottom line: No excuses to submitting the labs on time. Lab is considered submitted when you do a _git push_ to the corresponding lab repository before the deadline*

# Feedback Loop

(An optional task that will reinforce your learning throughout the semester)

Read this article and implement the little 'whatis' command in your .bashrc. https://lifehacker.com/how-can-i-quickly-learn-terminal-commands-1494082178

```
echo "Did you know that:"; whatis $(ls /bin | shuf -n 1)
```

This is a nice way to learn a new command everytime you log on!
