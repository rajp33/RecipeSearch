# Lab 1

* [Part 1](./part1-shell.md)
* [Part 2](./part2-IntroC.md)

# Rubric

* Task 1: output.txt 20%
* Task 2: myscript.sh 40% (well commented, complete without bugs, bonus: one that can accept arguments!)
* Task 3: main.c 40% (same criteria as above)

* Note: Your code **must** run on the Khoury machines. That is where you should test it, and this is where we grade it!
* Note: You must also commit any additional files into your repository so we can test your code.
  * Points will be lost if you forget!

# Grade

** Do not edit this part. The TAs will update your grade here **

# Feedback Loop

(An optional task that will reinforce your learning throughout the semester)

Read this article and implement the little 'whatis' command in your .bashrc. https://lifehacker.com/how-can-i-quickly-learn-terminal-commands-1494082178

```
echo "Did you know that:"; whatis $(ls /bin | shuf -n 1)
```

This is a nice way to learn a new command everytime you log on!
